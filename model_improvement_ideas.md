# Model Improvement Ideas

## 1. Bayesian Uncertainty Estimation in Stock Predictions

### Concept

Stock markets are inherently uncertain environments where predictions should include confidence intervals rather than point estimates. By incorporating Bayesian techniques, we can quantify the uncertainty in our predictions and make more robust investment decisions.

### How It Works

In traditional point-estimate predictions, we output a single value for expected returns. With Bayesian uncertainty, we instead output a distribution of possible outcomes with associated probabilities.

### Mathematical Formulation

Instead of predicting a point estimate $\hat{y}$, we predict a distribution $p(y|x)$.

For a neural network, we can implement this using:

1. **Monte Carlo Dropout**: By keeping dropout active during inference
2. **Ensemble methods**: Training multiple models and analyzing the variance
3. **Direct variance prediction**: Having the model output both mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$

The uncertainty-aware loss function becomes:
$$L = \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(y - \mu)^2 + \frac{1}{2}\log\sigma^2$$

### Example Implementation

```python
class UncertaintyMASTER(MASTERModel):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        # Modify the model to output both mean and variance
        self.mean_head = nn.Linear(d_model, 1)
        self.var_head = nn.Linear(d_model, 1)  # Outputs log variance

    def forward(self, x):
        features = super().extract_features(x)
        mean = self.mean_head(features)
        log_var = self.var_head(features)
        return mean, log_var

    def uncertainty_loss(self, mean, log_var, targets):
        precision = torch.exp(-log_var)
        return torch.mean(
            precision * (targets - mean) ** 2 + log_var
        )

    def predict_with_uncertainty(self, dataloader):
        means = []
        stds = []

        for x, _ in dataloader:
            mean, log_var = self.forward(x)
            std = torch.exp(0.5 * log_var)

            means.append(mean)
            stds.append(std)

        return means, stds
```

### Benefits

- Better risk management through confidence intervals
- Potential to create trading strategies that capitalize on uncertainty
- Improved model reliability by avoiding overconfident predictions

## 2. Dynamic Time Warping for Market Regime Detection

### Concept

Financial markets operate in different "regimes" (bull market, bear market, high volatility, low volatility). By detecting these regimes and adapting our model accordingly, we can improve prediction accuracy.

### How It Works

We use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to identify similar historical periods to the current market state. Then we condition our model's predictions on the detected regime, giving more weight to patterns from similar market conditions.

### Mathematical Formulation

DTW measures similarity between two temporal sequences by finding the optimal alignment between them. For sequences X and Y:

$$DTW(X, Y) = \min_{\pi} \sum_{(i,j) \in \pi} d(x_i, y_j)$$

Where π is a warping path and d is a distance function.

We can then use this to create a regime classifier:
$$R_t = \text{Classifier}(DTW(X_{t-w:t}, X_{historical}))$$

And condition our predictions on the regime:
$$\hat{y}_t = f(x_t, R_t)$$

### Example Implementation

```python
from scipy.spatial.distance import euclidean
from fastdtw import fastdtw

class RegimeAwareMASTER(MASTERModel):
    def __init__(self, *args, historical_windows=None, n_regimes=3, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.historical_windows = historical_windows
        self.n_regimes = n_regimes
        self.regime_embedding = nn.Embedding(n_regimes, d_model)

    def detect_regime(self, current_window, historical_windows):
        # Compute DTW distances to historical windows
        distances = []
        for hist_window in historical_windows:
            distance, _ = fastdtw(current_window, hist_window, dist=euclidean)
            distances.append(distance)

        # Assign to nearest regime cluster
        regime = np.argmin(distances) % self.n_regimes
        return regime

    def forward(self, x, regime_id):
        # Get base features
        features = super().extract_features(x)

        # Incorporate regime information
        regime_features = self.regime_embedding(torch.tensor(regime_id))
        combined_features = features + regime_features

        return self.prediction_head(combined_features)

    def predict(self, dataloader):
        predictions = []
        current_window = []  # Extract current market window

        for batch in dataloader:
            # Update current window
            # ...

            # Detect current regime
            regime = self.detect_regime(current_window, self.historical_windows)

            # Make prediction using regime information
            pred = self.forward(batch[0], regime)
            predictions.append(pred)

        return predictions
```

### Benefits

- Adapts to changing market conditions
- Reduces the impact of irrelevant historical patterns
- Improves robustness during market transitions

## 3. Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning for Market Features

### Concept

Stock market data contains rich patterns that can be learned without labels using self-supervised techniques. By pre-training our model to identify similar market states and distinguish them from dissimilar ones, we build stronger feature representations before fine-tuning on the actual prediction task.

### How It Works

We create "positive pairs" of similar market states (e.g., same stock on consecutive days or similar market conditions) and "negative pairs" of dissimilar states. The model learns to minimize distance between positive pairs and maximize distance between negative pairs in a learned representation space.

### Mathematical Formulation

For a market state x and its positive pair x⁺, along with N-1 negative examples {x₁⁻, ..., x\_{N-1}⁻}, the contrastive loss is:

$$L_{\text{contrastive}} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(z, z^+)/\tau)}{\exp(\text{sim}(z, z^+)/\tau) + \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \exp(\text{sim}(z, z_i^-)/\tau)}$$

Where z = encoder(x) are the encoded representations, sim is a similarity function (e.g., cosine similarity), and τ is a temperature parameter.

### Example Implementation

```python
class ContrastiveMASTER(MASTERModel):
    def __init__(self, *args, temperature=0.1, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.temperature = temperature
        self.projection_head = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(d_model, d_model),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(d_model, 128)  # Projection dimension
        )

    def contrastive_loss(self, anchors, positives, negatives):
        # Normalize embeddings
        anchors = F.normalize(anchors, dim=1)
        positives = F.normalize(positives, dim=1)
        negatives = F.normalize(negatives, dim=1)

        # Compute similarities
        pos_sim = torch.sum(anchors * positives, dim=1) / self.temperature
        neg_sim = torch.matmul(anchors, negatives.t()) / self.temperature

        # Contrastive loss
        logits = torch.cat([pos_sim.unsqueeze(1), neg_sim], dim=1)
        labels = torch.zeros(len(anchors), dtype=torch.long, device=anchors.device)

        return F.cross_entropy(logits, labels)

    def create_market_pairs(self, batch):
        """Generate positive and negative pairs from market data"""
        # Example: consecutive days from same stock as positives,
        # different stocks as negatives
        # ...
        return anchors, positives, negatives

    def pretrain(self, dataloader, epochs=10):
        """Pretrain with contrastive loss before standard training"""
        for epoch in range(epochs):
            for batch in dataloader:
                anchors, positives, negatives = self.create_market_pairs(batch)

                # Get representations
                z_anchors = self.projection_head(self.extract_features(anchors))
                z_positives = self.projection_head(self.extract_features(positives))
                z_negatives = self.projection_head(self.extract_features(negatives))

                # Compute contrastive loss
                loss = self.contrastive_loss(z_anchors, z_positives, z_negatives)

                # Optimization step
                self.optimizer.zero_grad()
                loss.backward()
                self.optimizer.step()
```

### Benefits

- Can leverage much larger datasets for pre-training
- Improves generalization to market conditions not seen during training
- Captures intrinsic market patterns beyond simple price movements
